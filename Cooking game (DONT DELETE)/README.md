One day, you try to become a cooking master. First, you must train up against basic robots. Once you have mastered cooking better than the 10 robots, you can battle against other cooking masters to become the best cooker ever! There will be a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly leaderboard. Hopefully, if the game lasts for a decade, there will be a pop-up of the best player of the decade. There will be custom pots, chefs, texture packs, etc. where you can use coins to get. There will also be shops and cooking teams to battle other cooking teams (like Clash of Clans/Clash Royale). You can also choose which version of the game you want to play (like Minecraft).

How will you make your game engaging?
I will make the game engage with those points I added before. There will be custom pots, chefs, texture packs, etc. where you can use coins to get. There will also be shops and cooking teams to battle other cooking teams (like Clash of Clans/Clash Royale). You can also choose which version of the game you want to play (like Minecraft). I could also have custom settings added where you can choose the number of pots, the number of ingredients needed, bomb spawn time, etc.
